# Project Nexus - Overhaul Project
## Duration: 20 days (10 of which were remote due to holidays)

### Purpose: Increase Intellectual capital of Chaos Foundry Leadership and Chaos Foundry Tech Division  (CFL and CFTD respectively) and refine site design, flow, establish
workflow for future projects. ("Translation from Darling's Corpo speak: We made The Chaos Foundry more aesthetically pleasing, interactive, faster and
Darling and me know how to do more stuff from a 'channel as professional devs' kinda way.)

## What did we achieve in timespan?
- Stream automation for faster stream response times ("Translation, Darling and me automated our streaming setup so like we just hit a command and stream is ready for us
instead of us finding and opening stuff and taking 5ever. Automated preflight checks too! <3") Yeah, it makes us faster and less error prone.
- Internal Process streamlined ("Translation: We got a calendar, a notion page and workflow for internal shit so Darling has literally no reason to miss stream even
after she lost her normie job and her whole sense of time was killed. <3")
- CFL collaborated with CFADA (Chaos Foundry Archive and Data Acquistion) for streamlined UI/UX, Supabase Edge Functions, Alpha testing of User profiles and
fourth place streaming endpoint. ("Translation: Darling and me worked with the old hag to get profiles for the site,
signups are invite only next to the shopping cart. <3  Oh, and now we have a way to keep track of the new users, ANDDDDD we have a merch store that works now.
JUST IN TIME FOR 2026 Q1. >;3" Yup, if you want to you can shop our fourthwall site via https://chaosfoundry.digital/shop "The shop.chaosfoundry.digital doesn't work. <3"
Yeah...)
- Cloudflare stream endpoint requisitioned, implemented into stream page with internal chat. ("Secret unmoderated chat is back, ghoulies. <3 And it's cheap so we
shouldn't fuck it up this time - and it has its own chat. >;3") Y-yeah. No user signup needed, but you do need to use a username. Not sure how we're going to watch it.
"INTEGRATE IT into Chat Aggregator. >;3"
- Thanks for reminding me, Yuki. Another change is that we have forked and stylized and kinda extended
[This github repo](https://github.com/bertugfahriozer/chat-aggregator) so we can see all of chat.
- CFUPS. "Hehehehe, CF Fuck ups. <3" >_>;; Yeah, I guess so?
[At this project, developed and am currently working on a way to multipost to YT Community, X, and Bsky](https://github.com/Archknight23/UnifiedPyblisher)

## "So, this and other stuff is why Darling and me have been awayyyy, because she and me are working on these projects over the holidays and
we got lost on the Store one. <3" Yeah, so basically we're using Fourthwall Storefront API to then have edge functions on supabase that pull products and
stuff, populate the .jsx file, present to you, and then route payments and stuff through our main fourthwall. "Mhm, if we could get it working properly with SSL,
it'd be more seamless. <3" It'll take 20 more days of head banging to figure THAT out... "Mhm. <3 Ghoulies, if you know the answer, pls help. <3"

HAPPY 2026, we are so back. "BACK and PROFESSIONAL now, ghoulies. <3"
